# **New instances for the SMPTSP** #

The shift minimisation personnel task scheduling problem (SMPTSP) deals with the problem of assigning tasks to a set of multi-skilled employees, whose working times have been determined beforehand. The SMPTSP was first introduced by [Krishnamoorthy et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221711010435).

## Instances ##

Based on an empirical hardness study, we generated new benchmark instances for the SMPTSP which include hard properties. The new dataset is available for download.
The instances use the same format as the original dataset, described [here](http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/ptaskinfo.html).

More details on the empirical hardness study as well as initial results for these new instances can be found in [Smet et al. (2014)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048314000176).
